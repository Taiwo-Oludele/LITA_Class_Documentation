# LITA Class Work Documentary
## Project Overview 
####  This project show case  a career path that includes specific class work tasks as to the introduction to Excel,  SQL  and Power BI, which has help me advance to a desirable Data Analyst role. it presents the above  three applications as an all-in-one data management software that allows for easily import, explore, clean, analyze, and visualisation of data. It typically involves a series of related live class samples  that provide me with increasing levels of responsibility and skills developed at LITA organized by the Incubator Hub.
## Data Source : Live class works
#### Function Text(Excel), Employee Id database (Sql) & HR data ( Power BI)
## Tools Used: Excel, SQL & Power Bi
 ### MS Excel:
 ##### Data Cleaning Text : Cleaning involves addressing common issues like extra spaces, blank cells, and spelling errors to ensure a clean and consistent dataset. Proper or Trim etc can be use for this function:

 ##### Conditional Formatting.: Conditional formatting argument will generate a TRUE result, conditional formatting rule is an If/Then statement along the lines of â€œIf this condition is TRUE, THEN format the cell this way.

 ##### Filtering : The VLOOKUP function is a type of filtering in Excel, it searches for a defined value across columns. The function takes a lookup value, table reference, and column index as mandatory parameters.
 
 ##### Pivot Tables : this is a powerful tool to calculate, summarize, and analyze data that lets you see comparisons, patterns, and trends in data.

 ### SQL: Structural Query Language
 ##### Sql Statement: A SQL statement is the most fundamental building block of SQL. statement is a command to be understood by the interpreter and executed by the SQL engine. e.g SELECT - extracts data from a database., UPDATE - updates data in a database., DELETE - deletes data from a database., INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database., CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database., ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database., CREATE TABLE - creates a new tabl
 ##### Sql Clauses : sql clauses can help filter out data according to users' needs. The main clauses are SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, INSERT and JOIN

 ### Power BI
 ##### Conditional ColumnColumn : it enable one  to create new columns based on values in other columns in your table your table.
 ##### Measure :a measure is evaluated in the context of the cell evaluated in a report or in a DAX query, the context of the cell depends on one selections in the report or on the shape of the DAX query.
 #### Slicer: A slicer is a way to filter data in Power BI. Slicers allow one to interactively filter data by selecting one or more values from a list.
